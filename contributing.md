# Contributing

The authors strongly believe that an open source project is improved both by the quality of code and the community involved in it. We welcome all pull requests, feature requests and bug reports.

You can participate by sharing code, ideas, or simply helping others. No matter what your skill level is, every contribution counts.

To make things easy we follow the [Silverstripe contribution guidelines](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/4/contributing/)
